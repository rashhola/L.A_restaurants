# Project Description
Gathered restaurant  data from LA county and yelp API. The data was transformed and loaded into a database.The purpose of this project is to understand the relationship between inspection and yelp ratings. A Data Warehouse was created to show the detailed information of yelp rating and LA county inspection rating to enable analysts to make business inferences and insight citing ratings, location, name and reviews. The data from yelp and LA county were extracted and manipulated without distorting the authenticity of the data and loaded into a database for effective querying and data analysis.
